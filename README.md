# ChatGPT Function Calling Experiments
My experiments learning and implementing ChatGPT function calling.

<br>

- ChatGPT does not call any functions.
- We define a function to do something e.g. add two numbers.
- We tell chatgpt that the function exists, what it does and what inputs it needs.
- ChatGPT gives us the input that's needed to call the function.
- We take this input and use it to call the function and get the result.
- We then pass the result to chatgpt as a message.
- ChatGPT then creates a new output message that gets shown to the user.

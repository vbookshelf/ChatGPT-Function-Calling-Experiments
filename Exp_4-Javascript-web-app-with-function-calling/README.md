## Exp_4 - Javascript ChatGPT web app with function calling
<br>

### Objective
- Create a chat web app in Javasript.
- Implement function calling in the app. The function mimics a call to a database containing student info.
  
### Notes
- Given a student id, when the model did not know the student name it hallucinated a name.
- The app works well.
- Add your API key and double click the index.html file to open the app in your browser.

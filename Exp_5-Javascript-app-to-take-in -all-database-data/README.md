## Exp_5 - Javascript ChatGPT web app with function calling that takes in all database data
<br>

### Objective
- Create a chat web app in Javasript.
- Implement function calling in the app.
- The app should take in all database data, then the user can chat with ChatGPT about the data.
  
### Notes
- There is one date of birth that is 1949. This can be used to test the model's reasoning ability by asking ChatGPT if it sees any errors in the data. It should reason that 4 students in the database are of similar age and that being born in 1949 is too old for a typical student.
